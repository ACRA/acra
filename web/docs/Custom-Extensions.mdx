## Implementing an extension
Create a class extending one of the supported interfaces. 

It has to be `public` and have a zero-argument public constructor (as a result, it cannot be an inner class).

Example:

<AndroidCode>

```kotlin
class MyAdmin : ReportingAdministrator {
    init {
        Log.d("MyAdmin", "MyAdmin was loaded")
    }
}
```

```java
public MyAdmin implements ReportingAdministrator {
    public MyAdmin() {
        Log.d("MyAdmin", "MyAdmin was loaded");
    }
}
```

</AndroidCode>

| Supported Extensions | Use Case |
| --- | --- |
| [`Collector`](pathname:///javadoc/latest/acra/org.acra.collector/-collector) | Collect additional custom data not covered by acra |
| [`ApplicationStartupCollector`](pathname:///javadoc/latest/acra/org.acra.collector/-application-startup-collector) | Collector which is also called at startup |
| [`ReportInteraction`](pathname:///javadoc/latest/acra/org.acra.interaction/-report-interaction) | Usually not needed, as the provided options (dialog, notification, toast) cover all reasonable choices |
| [`ReportingAdministrator`](pathname:///javadoc/latest/acra/org.acra.config/-reporting-administrator) | Control when reports are generated and when the application should be stopped |
| [`ReportSenderFactory`](pathname:///javadoc/latest/acra/org.acra.sender/-report-sender-factory) | Register custom report senders |
| [`ConfigurationBuilderFactory`](pathname:///javadoc/latest/acra/org.acra.config/-configuration-builder-factory) | Register custom configurations |
| [`SenderSchedulerFactory`](pathname:///javadoc/latest/acra/org.acra.scheduler/-sender-scheduler-factory) | Register custom sender scheduler, e.g. to prevent report sending based on custom conditions |
| [`StartupProcessor`](pathname:///javadoc/latest/acra/org.acra.startup/-startup-processor)  | Do something ACRA related on app start |
## Registering an extension
Choose one of the following alternatives:
### By annotation

Add the following dependencies:
<GradleCode>

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
compileOnly("com.google.auto.service:auto-service-annotations:1.1.1")
//either for java sources:
annotationProcessor("com.google.auto.service:auto-service:1.1.1")
//or for kotlin sources (requires kapt gradle plugin):
kapt("com.google.auto.service:auto-service:1.1.1")
//or for ksp(requires ksp gradle plugin):
ksp("dev.zacsweers.autoservice:auto-service-ksp:1.1.0")
ksp("com.google.auto.service:auto-service:1.1.1")
```

```groovy title="build.gradle"
compileOnly "com.google.auto.service:auto-service-annotations:1.1.1"
//either for java sources:
annotationProcessor "com.google.auto.service:auto-service:1.1.1"
//or for kotlin sources (requires kapt gradle plugin):
kapt "com.google.auto.service:auto-service:1.1.1"
//or for ksp(requires ksp gradle plugin):
ksp "dev.zacsweers.autoservice:auto-service-ksp:1.1.0"
ksp "com.google.auto.service:auto-service:1.1.1"
```

</GradleCode>

Then annotate your extension with the following:

<AndroidCode>

```kotlin
@AutoService(<ExtensionInterface>::class)
```

```java
@AutoService(<ExtensionInterface>.class)
```

</AndroidCode>

### By file

To manually register your extension, create a text file in `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/` named after the fully qualified interface name (e.g., `org.acra.sender.ReportSenderFactory`) containing the fully qualified name of your implementation class:

```
com.example.myapp.MySenderFactory
```

Your implementation must be `public` and have a public zero-argument constructor.
