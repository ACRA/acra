This page describes how to capture logs for ACRA.

## Gathering logs

1. Enable dev logging by inserting this snippet before `ACRA.init`:

<AndroidCode>

```kotlin
ACRA.DEV_LOGGING = true
```

```java
ACRA.DEV_LOGGING = true;
```

</AndroidCode>

2. If you want to report a bug or get help, stop your app and clear your logcat. Then start your app and do whatever you want to show, e.g. let it crash.

Post all logs **filtered for `tag:ACRA`**, not those of your application, those logs would not contain all relevant info!

import LogcatFilterImage from '@site/static/img/captures/logcat_filter.png'

<img src={LogcatFilterImage} alt="logcat filter"/>
