/**
 * Responsible for wrapping calls to PackageManager to ensure that they always complete without throwing RuntimeExceptions.
 * <p>
 *     Depending upon the state of the application it is possible that
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>Context has no PackageManager.</li>
 *         <li>PackageManager returned by Context throws RuntimeException("Package manager has died")
 *              because it cannot contact the remote PackageManager service.
 *         </li>
 *     </ul>
 *     I suspect that PackageManager death is caused during app installation.
 *     But we need to make ACRA bullet proof, so it's better to handle the condition safely so that the error report itself doesn't fail.
