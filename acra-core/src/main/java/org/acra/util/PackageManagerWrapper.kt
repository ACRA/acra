/**
 * Responsible for wrapping calls to PackageManager to ensure that they always complete without throwing RuntimeExceptions.
 * Depending upon the state of the application it is possible that
 *
 *  * Context has no PackageManager.
 *  * PackageManager returned by Context throws RuntimeException("Package manager has died")
 * because it cannot contact the remote PackageManager service.
 *
 *
 * I suspect that PackageManager death is caused during app installation.
 * But we need to make ACRA bullet proof, so it's better to handle the condition safely so that the error report itself doesn't fail.
