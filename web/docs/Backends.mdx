## Official Backends

[Acrarium](https://github.com/F43nd1r/Acrarium) is an open source backend created by the current maintainer of ACRA.

[Acralyzer](https://github.com/ACRA/acralyzer) is an open source backend created by the original author of ACRA.
It is currently unmaintained. It can be used as is, and is quite stable. But no support will be provided at the moment.

## ACRA 4 
Most of these Backends should work with ACRA 5, but their documentation hasn't been updated, most are not in active development.
